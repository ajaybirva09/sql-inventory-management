Inventory Management & Sales Reporting

Project purpose:
A compact SQL solution that demonstrates schema design, data integrity, typical OLTP operations, reporting queries, and a stored procedure — suitable to attach as a sample solution for application forms.

Files included:
1) solution.sql  - SQL script to create schema, insert sample data, and provide queries, indexes and a stored procedure.
2) solution_description.txt - Short human-readable description you can paste into forms or upload.

How to use:
- Run solution.sql in any relational DB (MySQL / MariaDB / PostgreSQL with minor syntax adjustments).
- The script creates tables: products, customers, orders, order_items.
- Includes sample inserts, sample reporting queries (daily sales, top products), and a stored procedure `sp_get_monthly_sales` that returns monthly sales totals.

Customize:
Replace sample data with your own, adjust data types or constraints for your target RDBMS, and add authentication/stored procedures as needed.
